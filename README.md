# Ray-Tracer Journey

## Starting the project
> 1. A good starting point is Peter Shirley's book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
>
> Steps made in this stage can be found in the [InOneWeekend](InOneWeekend) folder.

> 2. After understending the concept, it is time to speed up the process using **CUDA**
>
> Steps made in this stage can be found in the [CudaInOneWeekend](CudaInOneWeekend) folder.

<hr>

> 3. After getting a good grasp of the concepts, it is time to start implementing a more complex ray tracer. For this, it is time to look at the next book in series: [Ray Tracing: The Next Week](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
>
> Steps made in this stage can be found in the [TheNextWeek](TheNextWeek) folder.

> 4. Since we added lots of functionalities, the render time for Cpp single threaded version is quite big. It is time to speed up the process using **CUDA**.

> Steps made in this stage can be found in the [CudaTheNextWeek](CudaTheNextWeek) folder.
